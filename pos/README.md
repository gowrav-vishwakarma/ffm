A Point Of Sales system
Used as Sub system in a project. but can be developed at its own too ..

=============

This is multi POS system where one more application I have made for admin. Where admin can add new POS and make default ledgers and groups for all POS
 and each POS can then make their own groupd and ledgers too ..
 
 When required for extensive reports we can have a group and its all sub group in account for report.
 For any POS the record /ledger/group etc is usefull if its pos_id is null or its own id is there.
 
 Simply other then self records all records with pos_id null is also taken in account for all pos
